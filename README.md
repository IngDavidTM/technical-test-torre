<!-- FUTURE FEATURES -->

## 🔭 Future Features <a name="future-features"></a>

What else could I have done or improved if I had more time?
- Given more time, there are several improvements I would make to the project. Firstly, I would address any minor issues that I have identified. Additionally, I would expand the website's navigability by adding more pages that can be accessed through the hamburger button, such as sections for work experience, education, projects, and so on. I believe that incorporating animations would also enhance the user experience, and I would work to improve the desktop version of the website. Lastly, I would like to incorporate a new feature in the modal window that displays other individuals who possess the same skill set as the searched user.
